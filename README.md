## About inTouch

Stevens inTouch is an educational-cum-networking platform that allows students to stay in touch and talk about course content, upcoming deadlines and socialize.

Our inspiration for this project stems from the pressing need for an all-in-one platform that allows students to have academic discussions, and blow off steam. Need to confirm an upcoming deadline? Head to inTouch, open up your course group chat, and ask away. Need to sublet a room? Head to inTouch, post a picture and a description, select the appropriate category for your post, and sit back and relax (till the calls roll in). Need to show all your friends the best meme ever? Head to inTouch!
