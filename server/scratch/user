I acquired work experience in various fields during my undergrad as an Intern. Lately, I am concentrating on improving my problem-solving skills and knowledge of DS and Algorithms.\r\n\r\nI am eager to constantly learn new things. At the moment, my focus is on delving deeper into algorithms. I am also learning back-end development and of course, I am always up for trying out newer things whether it is Technical or some crazy life things.","courses":[{"id":56780,"name":"Introduction to Cloud Computing","code":"2022S CS 524-A","end_date":null},{"id":56734,"name":"Web Programming II","code":"2022S CS 554-A","end_date":"2022-05-18T00:00:00Z"},{"id":56769,"name":"Agile Methods for Software Development","code":"2022S CS 555-D","end_date":null},{"id":58451,"name":"Online Social Networks","code":"2022S CS 581-WS1","end_date":"2022-05-18T00:00:00Z"}],"designation":1,"gender":"0","contactNo":"5516897927","dob":"04/05/2022","friends":[],"privacy":[]}
